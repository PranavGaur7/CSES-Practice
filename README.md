# CSES Problem Set Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), which I am solving regularly as part of my journey to improve in **Competitive Programming (CP)** and strengthen my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** skills.  

---

## 📌 About
- I am practicing and uploading my solutions here consistently.
- The problems cover a wide range of topics:
  - Introductory Problems
  - Sorting & Searching
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Algorithms
  - Range Queries
  - Mathematics
  - Geometry
  - Advanced Techniques
- The goal is to build problem-solving intuition, learn new techniques, and get better at CP.

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
Most solutions are written in:
- **C++17** (primary language)
- Standard Template Library (**STL**) for efficient implementation

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each file corresponds to a single problem from CSES.
- Filenames are usually based on the problem name or ID for easier reference.
- Example:
```

Introductory_Problems/
├── weird_algorithm.cpp
├── missing_number.cpp
├── repetitions.cpp

```

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Solve the **entire CSES Problem Set** step by step.
- Improve consistency and speed in problem solving.
- Track my progress publicly to stay motivated.

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress
I’m actively updating this repository as I solve more problems.  
If you are also solving CSES, feel free to fork this repo, open issues, or discuss approaches!
